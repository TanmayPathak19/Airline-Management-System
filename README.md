# Airline-Management-System
The Airline Management System is designed to simplify and improve airline operations by automating tasks such as flight scheduling, ticket bookings, and customer management. It aims to reduce human errors and make it easier for both users and administrators to manage information efficiently.

This project is a Java-based Airline Management System that utilizes a MySQL database for data storage and management. The project consists of the following key files:

Files

1. AirlineManagementSystem [SQL].sql
This SQL file contains the database schema required for the Airline Management System. It includes:

Table definitions for storing flight details, booking information, customer data, and other essential entities.
Sample data to test the system and facilitate initial setup.
SQL queries that initialize the tables, relationships, and constraints required for the system's functioning.

2. JDBC conn.java
This Java file establishes a connection between the Java application and the MySQL database using JDBC (Java Database Connectivity). It includes:

-The configuration for database URL, username, and password.
-Methods to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on the database.
-Functions for handling user inputs and interactions with the database, allowing seamless integration between the frontend interface and backend database.

Getting Started:
To set up the Airline Management System on your local environment:

1. Import the SQL database using the provided .sql file.
2. Update the JDBC conn.java file with your database credentials.
3. Compile and run the Java application to start managing flight and booking data.

Technologies Used:

-Java for the core application logic.
-MySQL for the database backend.
-JDBC for connecting the Java application to the MySQL database.
